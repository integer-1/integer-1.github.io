                It was an absolute pleasure to work with Suwon. One of her many
                talents is that sheâ€™s great at communicating with others and
                coordinating multiple parties. Always willing to pull a lot more
                weight than expected is a plus. I would strongly recommend her
                to any future employer as a high performer with very quick
                response.

                Once upon a time, in the heart of the dense Amazon rain forest,
                there existed a forgotten expedition that would change the
                course of history. It all began when Dr. Amelia Thornton, a
                brilliant archaeologist, stumbled upon an ancient manuscript in
                a dusty corner of a library in Oxford.
