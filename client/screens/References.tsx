                  It was an absolute pleasure to work with Suwon. One of her
                  many talents is that sheâ€™s great at communicating with others
                  and coordinating multiple parties. Always willing to pull a
                  lot more weight than expected is a plus. I would strongly
                  recommend her to any future employer as a high performer with
                  very quick response.

                  Suwon is a talented and dedicated software developer. She was
                  an asset to her dev teams while completing group work at Dev
                  Academy and was unafraid to challenge herself with new
                  technologies and ways of doing things. She is self-motivated
                  and committed to producing high quality work.
