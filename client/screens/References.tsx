                  It was an absolute pleasure to work with Suwon. One of her
                  many talents is that sheâ€™s great at communicating with others
                  and coordinating multiple parties. Always willing to pull a
                  lot more weight than expected is a plus. I would strongly
                  recommend her to any future employer as a high performer with
                  very quick response.
