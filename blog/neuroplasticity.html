        Neuroplasticity, or the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior, 
        can help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-beingâ€“no matter our age. 
        <br><br> 
        It is content that inspires me to continue learning and exploring new things as I age. 
        By reviewing and attempting new challenges, I can engage in unlimited personal growth.
        <br><br> 
        When I don't understand it, I review it over and over again.

        Research Growth Mindset
      </h3>
      <p class="who-p">
        A growth mindset is a belief that you can develop your skills and talents through hard work, the right strategies, 
        and guidance from others.
        <br><br> 
        When I consistently cultivate positive thoughts on my own, I feel empowered and motivated to persevere rather than 
        giving up when encountering obstacles.
        <br><br> 
        This positive mindset acts as a driving force, reinforcing my determination to overcome challenges.
