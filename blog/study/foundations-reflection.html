        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - Benefits of Increasing my EQ : Especially, "It's optimal"
          <br>- The values that I consider to be of more importance to me : My strength is that I am self-reliant.
          <br>- I used to believe that EQ was innate, but now I realize that it can be developed and improved through practice.
        </p>

    <div class="who-div-style">
      <h3 class="who-h3">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - No matter what I'm doing, whether it's learning or programming, as long as I truly know myself, I can tackle challenges without letting doubt take over. That's why if I truly grasp the values, empathy, and self-awareness I've built up so far, I'll either face difficulties head-on or be a valuable asset in my relationships with others.


    </div>

    <div class="who-div-style">
      <h3 class="who-h3">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - I found it very difficult to listen to the other person for 2 minutes and remember everything. After this core task,  I've been wondering how I've been able to communicate with people in the past.

    </div>

    <div class="who-div-style">
      <h3 class="who-h3">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - It's Listening and Looping part. 
          <br>- It was difficult to listen to a story attentively for two minutes and then retell it exactly as it was told.


    </div>
    
    <div class="who-div-style">
      <h3 class="who-h3">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - When I truly understand and get to know myself, it seems to give me the inner strength to navigate challenging situations on my own, without experiencing unnecessary stress.
          <br>- To be honest, we're not majoring in software, so catching up with them technically might be a challenge.  Improving our communication skills and other human skills can help us compensate for our weaknesses.
 
    </div>

    <div class="who-div-style">
      <h3 class="who-h3">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - At first, it seemed like vague and abstract talk, so I had difficulty understanding. But now, it's different. It has been a great time because I can understand myself better internally.
