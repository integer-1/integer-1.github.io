  <h2 class="who-h2">Problem Solving</h2>

      <h3 class="who-h3">
        1. Were blocked on a simple problem :
      </h3>
      <p class="who-p">
        <span class = "span-bold">What was the problem?</span>
          <br>
          : I could't understand some questions of Javascript-kata tasks. 
        <br>
        <span class = "span-bold"> What problem-solving techniques did you use? </span>
          <br>
          : Using Googling and ChatGPT
        <br>
        <span class = "span-bold"> How did you feel throughout the process? </span>
          <br>
          : I should study more English words about coding.
        <br>
        <span class = "span-bold"> What did you learn? </span>
          <br>
          : I have to do twice as hard as others. Because I have to study coding and language at once.

      <h3 class="who-h3">
        2. Elegantly solved a problem :
      </h3>
      <p class="who-p">
        <span class = "span-bold">What was the problem?</span>
        <br>
          : When I practiced using the Date() method of array methods, I faced that different values were returned even though I inputted the same data (but in different formats).
        <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">What problem-solving techniques did you use?</span>
        <br>
          : 1. console.logging
          2. Trying something
          3. Googling and ask Chat GPT
          4. Asking coaches for help
        <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">How did you feel throughout the process?</span>
        <br>
          : During the process of solving this problem, I devised my own approach and sequence.
        <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">What did you learn?</span>
        <br>
          : I now realize the importance of considering time reduction and efficient problem-solving in the future.

      <h3 class="who-h3">
        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes :
      </h3>
      <p class="who-p">
        <span class = "span-bold">Pseudocode</span> 
          : Writing comments in plain English before starting the coding process.
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Trying something</span> 
          : When encountering something I don't remember or being unsure of my knowledge of techniques, above all, I just do it. 
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Rubber ducky method </span>
          : I haven't used this specific problem-solving technique before, but I have engaged in a similar process of solving problems by writing them down on my physical notes.
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Reading error messages</span>
          : It's a necessary tool!!!
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Console.logging</span> 
          : I like it as a temporary debugging tool. Because I can know what is the main problem immediately.
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Googling </span>
          : I use this as your main solution for problem-solving, along with seeking support from platforms like YouTube and Chat GPT.
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Asking your peers for help</span>
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Asking coaches for help </span>
          : I ask facilitators when I can't solve problems even using the above-all problem-solving processes.
          <br>
        <span class = "span-bold">Improving your process with reflection </span>
      </p>
    </div>   

    <div class="div-style">
      <h3 class="who-h3">
        4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so :
      </h3>
      <p class="who-p">
        I've had moments where I questioned whether the question I was asking was too trivial. On several occasions, I hesitated to seek help because I believed it might be a problem that could easily be resolved or researched. There have been instances where I found myself resorting to impractical solutions for problems that could have been solved within 10 minutes if I had sought assistance.
