  <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <div>
    1. My long term goal

    2. My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning

    3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

    4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

    a.  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    b. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    
    5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    - When encountering difficulties in my studies, my approach is to persistently attempt various solutions. I will start by conducting thorough online research, revisiting relevant handbooks, and seeking additional information. If uncertainty persists, I will readily seek assistance from facilitators. I truly resonate with the proverb that states "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."  If the problem is solved, I will share it on discord.
    
    6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    - Please teach me numerous techniques applicable in the field. I have a strong inclination to learn and broaden my knowledge.
    
    7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    - I can study and do computer before 3 pm or after 8 pm 'cause  I need to care for my child during the weekdays after 3 pm. Then, sometimes I can work during the weekend.
