  <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <div>
    1. My long term goal

    2. My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning

    3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

    4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

    a.  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    b. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

    6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

    7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
