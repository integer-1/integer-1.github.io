          My long term goal

          - Building my own business!!<br>
          I am dedicated to staying focused on my long-term goal of building my own business. 
          I know that the journey may be challenging. Through careful planning, 
          continuous learning, and the willingness to adapt, I am confident in my ability 
          to turn my dream into a reality.

          My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - My strength in being self-reliant means I am proactive in seeking out learning 
        opportunities. I take the initiative to identify areas of improvement, find relevant 
        resources, and actively engage in learning activities. I am adept at finding and 
        utilizing various learning resources, such as Google, youtube, books, tutorials, 
        and communities, to enhance my knowledge and skills. I am more likely to navigate 
        through challenges, seek alternative approaches, and adjust my learning strategies 
        when necessary. <br><br>

         While I recognize the value of self-reliance, I also understand the importance of 
        considering potential limitations. Relying solely on myself may limit exposure to 
        diverse perspectives and alternative learning methods. Therefore, I am committed to 
        actively seeking input from others to enrich my understanding and gain different 
        insights.

        yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - I said above that Actively seeking input from others is a valuable approach to 
        learning. By engaging with diverse perspectives and seeking different insights, 
        I am broadening my understanding and discovering new ways of thinking. This commitment 
        demonstrates my openness to collaboration and a willingness to embrace alternative 
        viewpoints, which can greatly enhance my learning experience. Remember to actively 
        participate in discussions, seek feedback, and remain receptive to new ideas. By doing 
        so, I will continue to grow and expand my knowledge base.

          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
          This should include: <br>

          a. An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          b. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - I plan to achieve that I will maintain open and respectful communication channels 
          with my peers and facilitators. Clear and timely communication will ensure smooth 
          collaboration and enable us to address any challenges or concerns proactively.
          And then, I will practice effective time management, such as setting realistic 
          deadlines, creating a schedule, and allocating specific timetables for different 
          tasks. This will help me maintain a structured approach and avoid procrastination.

          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

        </h3>
        <p class="who-p">
          - When encountering difficulties in my studies, my approach is to persistently attempt various solutions. I will start by conducting thorough online research, revisiting relevant handbooks, and seeking additional information. If uncertainty persists, I will readily seek assistance from facilitators. I truly resonate with the proverb that states "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."  If the problem is solved, I will share it on discord.

          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

        <p class="who-p">
          - I can study and do computer before 3 pm or after 8 pm 'cause  I need to care for my child during the weekdays after 3 pm. Then, sometimes I can work during the weekend.
