<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.377); padding: 5px;">
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
  Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
  the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
  <p style="font-family: 'Asap', sans-serif;">- When I contracted the coronavirus a year ago, I promptly reported it to the government 
  and diligently quarantined myself without leaving the house. My primary concern was 
  preventing others from falling ill because of me. I firmly believe that safety takes 
  precedence over personal freedom, and I am confident that I made the right decision. 
  Even now, looking back a year later, I would still make the same choice if I were to 
  evisit that time</p>

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.377); padding: 5px; margin-top: 10px;">
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and 
  identity.</h3>
  <p style="font-family: 'Asap', sans-serif;">- When I was young, I learned the value of self-reliance and independence through the home 
  education provided by my parents. They encouraged me to solve problems on my own, 
  fostering a sense of autonomy and resourcefulness. This early exposure to self-reliance 
  became a significant strength that continues to shape my learning journey. When faced 
  with setbacks or difficulties, I have the determination to keep pushing forward, knowing
  that I have the capability to find solutions and achieve my goals. self-reliance has 
  taught me the importance of perseverance and resilience.  I am grateful for the lessons 
  learned in my early years, as they continue to shape and empower me as a lifelong learner.</p>

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.377); padding: 5px; margin-top: 10px;">
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
  <p style="font-family: 'Asap', sans-serif;">- My strength is that I am self-reliant. Being self-reliant means I have the ability 
  to motivate myself. I am driven by internal factors rather than relying on external 
  validation or encouragement. This self-motivation will help me stay focused and committed 
  to my learning, even when faced with challenges or setbacks.  And then, I am resourceful 
  and adept at finding solutions independently. This skill will prove invaluable during 
  my learning journey, as I will encounter obstacles or difficulties along the way.
  My ability to analyze problems and find creative solutions will help me overcome 
  these challenges and continue progressing.</p>

  <h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might 
  these affect your learning journey?</h3>
  <p>- I now have a little and cute child. The most important value in my current life is 
  ensuring that my child grows up safely and healthily. If my values are limited in terms 
  of studying or work in the future, I believe I will prioritise my child. However, if that 
  is not the case, I will do my best to learn and find joy. </p>

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.377); padding: 5px; margin-top: 10px;">
  <h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there 
  was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they 
  were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
  <p style="font-family: 'Asap', sans-serif;">- During my tenure as a global business strategist, I endeavored to create a business 
  prototype tailored to the unique profit structures of each country and presented it to 
  the CEO. However, the diversity of laws and accounting methods across countries made it 
  impossible to develop a prototype model. Although there were discussions about 
  establishing country-specific models, the plan was ultimately halted due to 
  the substantial initial costs involved. Reflecting on the situation now, 
  I believe that developing a representative model while adapting specific details 
  could have been a viable approach. It is disheartening to consider how the outcomes 
  might have differed had the CEO's perspective been embraced and incorporated.</p>
