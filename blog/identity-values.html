      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.

    <p class="who-p">
      - When I contracted the coronavirus a year ago, 
      I promptly reported it to the government and diligently quarantined myself without leaving 
      the house. My primary concern was preventing others from falling ill because of me. 
      I firmly believe that safety takes precedence over personal freedom, and I am confident 
      that I made the right decision. Even now, looking back a year later, I would still make 
      the same choice if I were to evisit that time

  <div class="who-div-style">
    <h3 class="who-h3"> 
      Describe how your culture and the people 
      around you have influenced your values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p class="who-p">
      - When I was young, I learned the value of self-reliance and independence through the home 
      education provided by my parents. They encouraged me to solve problems on my own, 
      fostering a sense of autonomy and resourcefulness. This early exposure to self-reliance 
      became a significant strength that continues to shape my learning journey. When faced 
      with setbacks or difficulties, I have the determination to keep pushing forward, knowing
      that I have the capability to find solutions and achieve my goals. self-reliance has 
      taught me the importance of perseverance and resilience.  I am grateful for the lessons 
      learned in my early years, as they continue to shape and empower me as a lifelong learner.

  <div class="who-div-style">
    <h3 class="who-h3">
      Identify your strengths and how they will 
      support you during your learning journey.
    </h3>
    <p class="who-p">
      - My strength is that I am self-reliant. Being self-reliant means I have the ability 
      to motivate myself. I am driven by internal factors rather than relying on external 
      validation or encouragement. This self-motivation will help me stay focused and committed 
      to my learning, even when faced with challenges or setbacks.  And then, I am resourceful 
      and adept at finding solutions independently. This skill will prove invaluable during 
      my learning journey, as I will encounter obstacles or difficulties along the way.
      My ability to analyze problems and find creative solutions will help me overcome 
      these challenges and continue progressing.

      - I now have a little and cute child. The most important value in my current life is 
      ensuring that my child grows up safely and healthily. If my values are limited in terms 
      of studying or work in the future, I believe I will prioritise my child. However, if that 
      is not the case, I will do my best to learn and find joy.

  <div class="who-div-style">
    <h3 class="who-h3">
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there 
      was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they 
      were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>
    <p class="who-p">
      - During my tenure as a global business strategist, I endeavored to create a business 
      prototype tailored to the unique profit structures of each country and presented it to 
      the CEO. However, the diversity of laws and accounting methods across countries made it 
      impossible to develop a prototype model. Although there were discussions about 
      establishing country-specific models, the plan was ultimately halted due to 
      the substantial initial costs involved. Reflecting on the situation now, 
      I believe that developing a representative model while adapting specific details 
      could have been a viable approach. It is disheartening to consider how the outcomes 
      might have differed had the CEO's perspective been embraced and incorporated.
