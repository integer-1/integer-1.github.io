  <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>
  
  <h4>1. Static</h4>
    <div>
      <p>The default!!</p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="blog/html-css/Static-image.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Static image"><br>
      <span>No effect</span><br>

    </div>
    
    <h4>2. Relative</h4>
    <div>
      <p>An element whose computed position value is relative</p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="blog/html-css/Relative-image.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Relative image"><br>
      <span>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the 
        document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of 
        top, right, bottom, and left. </span>
    </div>
    
    <h4>3. Absolute</h4>
    <div>
      <p>An element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed</p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="blog/html-css/Absolute-image.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Absolute image"><br>
      <span>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space 
        is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative
         to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed 
         relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is 
         determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</span>
    </div>
    
    <h4>4. Fixed</h4>
    <div>
      <p>The element is placed in the same position on every page</p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="blog/html-css/Fixed-image.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Fixed image"><br>
      <span>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space 
        is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative
         to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except 
         when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter 
         property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec)
         , or the will-change property is set to transform, in which case that 
         ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser 
         inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing 
         block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top
         , right, bottom, and left.</span>
    </div>
