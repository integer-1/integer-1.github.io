  <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
    <h4>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h4>
    <div>
      <p>HTML :  Bone /  CSS :  appearance / JavaScript : Brain </p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="../blog/image/jshtmlcss.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="js, html and css"><br>
      <span> - JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It works alongside HTML and CSS to create engaging and responsive websites. HTML structures the content, CSS styles the presentation, and JavaScript brings life to the web page by enabling interaction and dynamic modifications.</span><br>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h4>
    <div>
      <p>Control flow : <br>1. Apply toothpaste 2. Brush your teeth [Start a loop]~[End the loop] 3. Rinse your mouth 4. Clean the toothbrush</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 13px;">[Start a loop] a. Select the next tooth b. Move the toothbrush in a circular motion to clean the tooth c. Repeat the previous two steps for each tooth in your mouth [End the loop] </p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="../blog/image/loop.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Control flow and loops"><br>
      <span> - Control flow determines the sequence of actions you take and Loops allow you to repeat a certain set of actions multiple times until a specific condition is met.</span>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it </h4>
    <div>
      <p>Document Object Model</p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="../blog/image/DOM.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="DOM"><br>
      <span> - DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. And then DOM rpovides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document.</span>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>
    <div>
      <p>Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.</p>
      <img class="basicfont" src="../blog/image/arrayandobject.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Array and Object"><br>
      <span> - The main difference lies in the syntax and mechanism of accessing data. Arrays use numeric indices, while objects use string keys to access their respective elements or properties.</span>
    </div>
  
    <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful </h4>
    <div>
      <p>Functions are one of the fundamental concepts in programming.
      </p>
      <span> - Functions are the basic building block of JavaScript. Functions are a powerful feature in JavaScript that enables you to write modular, reusable, and organized code. Functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it multiple times. Functions make JavaScript code more readable, organized, reusable, and maintainable.
